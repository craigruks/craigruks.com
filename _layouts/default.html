                        Hello! I see you just tried to reach the old Active Hatch site. 
                        Since my personal site now shows my recent work and skills set, 
                        I decided to consolodate down to a single, all-encompasing site.

                    you&rsquo;ll find some projects (the ones I&rsquo;m 
                    allowed to admit to) that I&rsquo;ve been proud to be a part 
                    of in the last couple years. I&rsquo;m really into learning/utilizing

                            <p>
                                For GE, Welikesmall built a site where users can submit photos 
                                to celebrate what works in America. I built a custom 
                                CMS to control all major aspects of the site (winners, 
                                photo moderation, weekly judges and themes, etc). I 
                                also cut up the designs into HTML5, JS, and CSS. The 
                                site required logging in through Facebook or Twitter and 
                                then submitting photos via Facebook, Instagram or from 
                                your computer so I wrote a number of jQuery plugins to take 
                                care of authorization, submitting a photo, and a modal handler.

                                Welikesmall was tasked with wireframing, designing and 
                                cutting the design up into modular code pieces for 
                                the 2012 Oscars. Another coworker and I were 
                                tasked with cutting up the designs. Notable pieces 
                                I did were the overall site header and footer and 
                                the history page (including the Javascript to transition 
                                between years and decades, as well as the JSON structure and 
                                AJAX calls to pull new data in for a new timeframe).

                                My job on this site was to put together the backend 
                                of this site. We went with Python/Django/MySQL and 
                                a shopping cart system called Satchmo. Satchmo also 
                                required me to install Fedex/USPS plugins and 
                                AuthorizeNet. I also wrote the JS that controls the 
                                product image zooming.

                                A coworker and I were lamenting on how much could be 
                                improved with the current wikis on the market in 
                                terms of design and usability, so we decided to take 
                                a crack at it. Of note in the codebase is a 
                                versioning class, where Will refactored diff 
                                functionality and I ported over patch functionality from Python. 
                                I also designed the entire app as well as the frontend 
                                site, which both feature HTML5 with full support of 
                                IE6-9, Safari 3+, FF 3+, and Chrome. I also used 
                                media queries on the frontend site to create 
                                optimized versions for iOS and Android based 
                                devices.

                                Upon a tight deadline I wrote the front-end and back-end 
                                code for this site in two weeks. This included a custom 
                                CMS for the blog, events, partners, news, as well as 
                                tagging abilities on blogs. I cut up the site into 
                                strict XHTML 1.0, and integrated any jQuery necessary 
                                (including the homepage slideshow and an HTML5 video 
                                player that sat in a modal window). I also integrated a 
                                third party vendor with multiple contact forms. And what 
                                an amazing client Desktone was to work with! They were 
                                easy to find solutions with, extremely responsive, and 
                                were quite timely.

                                build Harpo Creative Works a new website. They 
                                provided a fluid design and I cut it up and 
                                integrated into ExpressionEngine 2.0. All of their 
                                works are dynamic thanks to EE, and they have the 
                                ability to add any audio, video, or photo as a piece 
                                and the system knows how to treat each accordingly. 
                                Of particular interest is the fact that the client 
                                only has to enter in the URL of a video work and the 
                                site knows to parse it and show it in a modal window 
                                on the fly.

                            Upon realizing that iMarc had many internal sites where usernames and passwords 
                            were all stored separately, I tackled building a secure, single sign-on service 
                            for all sub-sites of iMarc. This meant writing the initial code base as well as 
                            collaborating with coworkers during regular meetings to ensure that the code was 
                            solid. All information sent from Identity is encrypted into HMAC strings using 
                            public key encryption (OpenSSL), and then SHA-256 is run on those strings. All 
                            sessions are restricted to https by running the core service under an SSL to 
                            prevent session fixation. Each user has a GUID, and information is pushed (in JSON) 
                            whenever asked for by the remote site (typically during log in but can asked at any 
                            time).

                                I needed to allow a user to select upcoming seasons to filter trips, so I wrote an Iterator class to accomplish this. You construct upon any valid date and it allows you to iterate from that point in time over a static array of all possible season change dates within the PHP range of time(), or return a range of seasons based on an entered end date.

                                Wrote a Flourish ORM plugin at iMarc for dynamically adding many to many relationships with tags. You can make a single call in an init script to load the class and subsequently tie in a tags table to any number of SQL tables, allowing for relational querying and storing of tags on the fly when active records are stored. I took it a step further and also allowed querying of tags via a set of active records.
